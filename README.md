1. Programming Test – First Screening
    This repository contains my solutions for the 4 problems given in the Programming Test.  
    All programs are written in Python 3.  
    Each problem is saved in a separate file:
    
    - Program-1.py – Calculator using Class  
    - Program-2.py – Generate Odd Number Series  
    - Program-3.py – Special Pattern Odd Number Series  
    - Program-4.py – Multiples Counter

2. Problem Descriptions
    Problem-1: Calculator Using Class
    Create a small calculator which performs Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division using a class.  
    Inputs: 
    - a = double (float)  
    - b = double (float)  
    - operation = string (Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/Division or +, -, *, /)
    
    Problem-2: Odd Number Series
    With a single integer as input, generate the first a odd numbers.  
    Example:  
    - Input: 4  
    - Output: 1 3 5 7
    
    Problem-3: Special Pattern Odd Number Series
    With a single integer as input, generate the following pattern:
    
    | Input (a) | Output              |
    |-----------|---------------------|
    |1|1|
    |2|1|
    |3|1 3 5|
    |4|1 3 5|
    |5|1 3 5 7 9|
    |6|1 3 5 7 9|
    
    Problem-4: Multiples Counter
    Get the total count of numbers listed in the array which are multiples of [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].  
    
    Example:  
    Input:  
    [1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30] 
    
    Output:
    {1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}

3. How to Run
    1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
    2. Clone or download this repository.
    3. Run each program separately from the command line:
    python Program-1.py
    python Program-2.py
    python Program-3.py
    python Program-4.py
    Each program will prompt for input (if required) and print the output to the screen.
4. Note
    All programs are written in Python 3.
    No external libraries are needed.
